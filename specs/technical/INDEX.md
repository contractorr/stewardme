# Technical Spec Index

This index is intentionally small. The canonical machine-readable source of
truth is [specs/catalog.yaml](../catalog.yaml).

## Supporting Specs

All other active files under `specs/technical/` are supporting specs. They are
still active, but they refine a tracked module or document a specific subsystem
instead of acting as the top-level technical routing point.

Check `specs/catalog.yaml` for the complete supporting-spec list and future
archive moves.
