# Technical Feature Map

## Overview

## Implementation Audit - 2026-03-09

Current implementation status after repo audit:

- Attach-to-Ask Bridge - route, storage, retrieval, transcript persistence, and first-party web chat UX are implemented. Chat-origin uploads stay hidden until explicitly saved into Library.
- Extraction Receipt - receipt store, journal hooks, and receipt endpoint are implemented. First-party dashboard rendering is still missing.
- Recurring Thread Inbox - thread APIs and action endpoints are implemented. A dedicated web inbox surface is still missing.
- Dossier Escalation Engine - escalation engine, storage, and API routes are implemented, and shared escalation-context assembly now feeds suggestions, dedicated escalation routes, and return-briefing reuse with active-dossier suppression. First-party dossier and escalation management UI remains incomplete.
- Since-You-Were-Away + Why-Now - `GET /api/greeting` is now wired into a dedicated home `return_brief` card, and recommendation surfaces render expandable `why_now` chips. Harvested-outcome reasoning is inspectable through chip detail when present, while suggestion-chip coverage still depends on a first-party suggestions surface.
- Outcome Harvester - store, evaluation, ranking boost, and override APIs are implemented. No first-party web review surface exists yet.
- Company Movement, Hiring Activity, and Regulatory Change - specialized APIs and stores are implemented. The current Radar UI still consumes only the generalized intel feed and follow-up flows.
- Assumption Watchlist - store, signal matching, memory adapter, routes, journal suggestion capture, and shared briefing/return-brief integration are implemented. A dedicated assumptions workspace is still missing, but assumption updates are now consumed outside the standalone route.

This map summarizes how the 10 new technical feature specs fit into StewardMe's existing architecture. It highlights:

1. which features share modules and infrastructure
2. which new stores, tables, and routes are introduced
3. which scheduler jobs or background processes are needed
4. the recommended technical build order based on dependency depth

This file mirrors `specs/functional/00-feature-map.md`, but focuses on implementation shape rather than product behavior.

## Recommended Technical Build Order

1. `specs/technical/attach-to-ask-bridge.md`
   - activates an already-planned advisor capability and mostly reuses Library + advisor plumbing
2. `specs/technical/extraction-receipt.md`
   - layers transparency onto existing journal post-create work
3. `specs/technical/recurring-thread-inbox.md`
   - depends mainly on fixing existing thread route wiring and adding a state overlay
4. `specs/technical/dossier-escalation-engine.md`
   - builds directly on threads, suggestions, dossiers, and recent intel
5. `specs/technical/since-you-were-away-why-now.md`
   - enriches greeting and suggestion surfaces after the underlying signals are more mature
6. `specs/technical/outcome-harvester.md`
   - adds learning once recommendations, action plans, and journaling evidence are already flowing
7. `specs/technical/company-movement-pipeline.md`
   - establishes company identity and structured event infrastructure
8. `specs/technical/hiring-activity-pipeline.md`
   - shares the company identity and scheduling base while adding hiring-specific logic
9. `specs/technical/regulatory-change-pipeline.md`
   - reuses monitoring patterns for a new source family with different classification rules
10. `specs/technical/assumption-watchlist.md`
   - benefits most once multiple specialized signal pipelines already exist

## Why this order

- The first three features mostly improve existing loops without introducing large new external-monitoring systems.
- The middle three create more adaptive and explainable product behavior.
- The next three expand the surface area of monitored external signals.
- Assumptions come last because they are strongest when several signal families already exist.

## Highest-Risk Technical Dependencies

| Dependency | Risk |
|---|---|
| Web thread-route fix | Recurring Thread Inbox depends on unblocking an existing miswire |
| Chat attachment hidden/saved lifecycle | Needs clean Library integration without confusing user-visible duplication |
| Company identity resolution | Shared company monitoring can become noisy without stable normalization |
| New scheduler jobs | More background jobs increase failure modes and operational complexity |
| Assumption extraction precision | Low-precision extraction would pollute the watchlist and downstream memory |

## Open Questions

- Should there also be a `specs/technical/00-storage-map.md` later if these tables grow further?
- Should `Outcome Harvester` and `Assumption Watchlist` eventually merge into a more general private learned-state subsystem, or stay separate for clarity?
