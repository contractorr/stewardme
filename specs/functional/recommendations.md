# Recommendations & Suggestions

**Status:** Approved
**Author:** —
**Date:** 2026-03-06

## Problem

Users want actionable, personalized recommendations (articles to read, skills to learn, projects to try) based on their profile, goals, and current intel — not generic lists. They also need a unified view of "things the system suggests I do" that combines both LLM-generated recommendations and time-budgeted daily brief items.

## Users

Users with a completed profile and some journal history. Recommendations improve as more data accumulates.

## Desired Behavior

### Generation

1. System periodically generates recommendations by analyzing user profile, journal patterns, goals, and recent intel
2. Each recommendation is scored on three weighted dimensions: relevance (50%), impact (30%), feasibility (20%)
3. Recommendations below a minimum score threshold (default 6.0) are filtered out
4. At most 3 recommendations per category are kept to avoid overload
5. Recommendations are deduplicated against recent ones (exact content-hash match over a 30-day window)

### Viewing

1. User lists current recommendations
2. Each recommendation shows: title, category, score, rationale, and suggested action
3. When a recommendation is supported by watchlist-matched intel, the system can include lightweight watchlist evidence so the user can see which tracked theme or entity informed the suggestion
3. Recommendations are sorted by score descending

### Feedback

1. User can rate a recommendation on a 1–5 numeric scale with an optional comment
2. Rating feeds back into the scoring system via two boost components (engagement, rating) for future relevance tuning
3. User can dismiss a recommendation to remove it from active list

### Delivery

1. Recommendations are saved as markdown files in `~/coach/recommendations/`
2. On the configured schedule (default: weekly, Sunday 8am), new recommendations are generated and stored
3. Available for retrieval via CLI, web, and MCP

### Suggestions (unified view)

Suggestions merge recommendations with daily brief items into a single ranked list — both are "things the system suggests I do."

1. `GET /api/suggestions` returns a combined list:
   - **Brief items** (high-priority): stale goal nudges, goal-intel matches, time-budgeted recommendation picks
   - **Remaining recommendations** not already in the brief: deeper LLM-generated suggestions
2. Each suggestion has: source (`brief` | `recommendation`), kind, title, description, action (chat pre-fill), priority, score
3. Brief items appear first (already priority-ranked by urgency), followed by remaining recommendations
4. Dedup: recommendations that appear in the brief are not repeated in the remaining list

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Recommendations are personalized based on profile and journal content
- [ ] Scoring weights (relevance 50%, impact 30%, feasibility 20%) sum to 1.0; recommendations below threshold are excluded
- [ ] Max 3 per category prevents recommendation fatigue
- [ ] Dedup via exact content hash prevents the same recommendation from recurring within 30 days
- [ ] User can rate recommendations and ratings affect future scoring
- [ ] Recommendations are viewable via CLI, web, and MCP
- [ ] Scheduled generation runs without manual intervention
- [ ] `GET /api/suggestions` merges daily brief items and recommendations into unified ranked list
- [ ] Brief items ranked first by priority, remaining recs follow sorted by score

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| No profile, no journal | Cannot generate meaningful recommendations; return empty or generic fallback |
| All recommendations below threshold | Return empty list, not low-quality recs |
| User rates everything low (1-2) | Rating/engagement boosts adjust; future recs shift focus |
| No intel items available | Recommendations based on profile + journal only |
| Duplicate recommendation within 30 days | Filtered by content-hash dedup |
| No stale goals, no intel matches | Suggestions shows only recommendations (no brief items) |
| Only brief items, no scored recs | Suggestions shows only brief nudges |

## Out of Scope

- External content fetching (recommendations link out but don't fetch full articles)
- Recommendation categories management (categories are derived, not user-defined)
- Email or push delivery of recommendations
