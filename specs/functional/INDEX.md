# Functional Spec Index

This index is intentionally small. The canonical machine-readable source of
truth is [specs/catalog.yaml](../catalog.yaml).
Use this file for quick human scanning of the active tracked features.

## Supporting Specs

All other active files under `specs/functional/` are supporting specs. They are
still active, but they refine or extend a tracked feature instead of acting as
the first routing target for implementation work.

Check `specs/catalog.yaml` for the complete supporting-spec list and future
archive moves.
