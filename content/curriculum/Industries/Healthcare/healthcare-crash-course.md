# Healthcare Industry Crash Course
*Business Models & Technology Focus*

## 1. Healthcare Fundamentals

### Core Concept: Care Delivery & Payment
Healthcare = services to diagnose, treat, prevent illness. Unique market: third-party payer model (someone other than patient usually pays), information asymmetry, regulatory intensity.

**The flow:** Patient receives care → Provider bills payer → Payer adjudicates/pays → Patient pays remainder

### System Overview

| System Type | Description | Examples |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Single-payer** | Government pays, private delivery | Canada, UK (NHS) |
| **Multi-payer** | Mix of private/public insurance | US, Germany |
| **Out-of-pocket** | Direct patient payment | Many developing nations |

US breakdown: ~50% private insurance, ~35% government (Medicare/Medicaid), ~10% uninsured

## 3. Business Model Deep Dive

### Provider Economics

**Revenue model:**
```
Patient Volume × Reimbursement Rate × Payer Mix = Revenue
- Operating Costs = Margin
```

**Reimbursement models:**

| Model | Description | Risk |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **Fee-for-service (FFS)** | Pay per procedure/visit | Volume incentive, low risk |
| **Capitation** | Fixed per-member-per-month (PMPM) | Provider takes utilization risk |
| **Bundled payment** | Fixed payment for episode | Provider takes episode risk |
| **Value-based** | Tied to quality/outcomes | Shared savings/losses |

**Key metrics:**
- Case mix index (CMI): Severity/complexity of patients
- Average length of stay (ALOS)
- Bed utilization rate
- Net patient revenue per adjusted discharge

### Payer Economics

**Revenue:** Premiums + investment income

**Medical Loss Ratio (MLR):**
```
Medical Costs / Premium Revenue = MLR
```
ACA requires: 80% (individual/small group), 85% (large group)

**Key metrics:**
- MLR: 80-88% typical
- Administrative costs: 12-20%
- Per-member-per-month (PMPM) cost
- Days in claims payable

### Value-Based Care Progression

```
FFS → Pay-for-Performance → Bundled → Shared Savings → Full Capitation
     ←—— Increasing provider risk ——→
```
