# Insurance Industry Crash Course
*Business Models & Technology Focus*

---

## 1. Insurance Fundamentals

### Core Concept: Risk Pooling & Transfer
Insurance = mechanism where many pay small amounts so few who experience losses get compensated. Insurer aggregates risk across pool, uses law of large numbers to predict losses.

**The deal:** Policyholder pays premium → Insurer promises to pay claims → Risk transfers from individual to pool

### Types Overview

| Type | What it covers | Key characteristics |
|------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Life** | Death, retirement | Long-tail, investment-heavy, predictable mortality |
| **Health** | Medical expenses | High frequency, regulatory complexity, network-dependent |
| **P&C (Property & Casualty)** | Property damage, liability | Short-tail (mostly), catastrophe exposure, reinsurance-heavy |

P&C subcategories: auto, home, commercial, specialty/excess & surplus (E&S)

## 2. Value Chain & Key Players

### Carriers/Insurers
- Take on risk, hold capital, pay claims
- Regulated entities with capital/solvency requirements
- Examples: State Farm, Allstate, Travelers, Chubb, AIG

### Reinsurers
"Insurance for insurance companies"
- Carriers cede portions of risk to reinsurers
- Enables capacity (write more policies than capital would allow)
- Smooths earnings, protects against catastrophes
- Treaty vs facultative reinsurance
- Examples: Munich Re, Swiss Re, Berkshire Hathaway Re

### Distribution Channels

| Channel | Description | Economics |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Captive agents** | Exclusive to one carrier | Salary + commission, carrier controls relationship |
| **Independent agents/brokers** | Represent multiple carriers | Commission-based, own customer relationship |
| **Direct** | Carrier sells directly | Lower acquisition cost, digital-first |
| **Aggregators** | Lead gen/comparison sites | Pay per lead/quote, high CAC |

### MGAs/MGUs (Managing General Agents/Underwriters)
- Delegated underwriting authority from carrier
- Act as carrier's underwriting arm for specialty lines
- Keep portion of premium, carrier takes risk
- Popular model in E&S/specialty markets
- Growing fast—enables speed-to-market without carrier infrastructure

### TPAs (Third-Party Administrators)
- Handle claims processing, policy servicing on behalf of carriers
- Common in self-insured programs, workers' comp
- Examples: Sedgwick, Gallagher Bassett

### Service Providers
- Core systems vendors (Guidewire, Duck Creek, Majesco)
- Data providers (LexisNexis, Verisk, ISO)
- Reinsurance brokers (Aon, Guy Carpenter, Willis Re)

## 3. Business Model Deep Dive

### Revenue Streams

**1. Underwriting Income**
```
Premium Earned - Claims Paid - Expenses = Underwriting Profit/Loss
```

**2. Investment Income (The Float)**
- Premiums collected upfront, claims paid later
- "Float" = money held between collection and payout
- Invested in bonds, equities, alternatives
- Buffett's Berkshire model: use float as cheap capital

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Loss Ratio** | (Claims + LAE) / Earned Premium | 60-70% typical |
| **Expense Ratio** | Operating Expenses / Written Premium | 25-35% typical |
| **Combined Ratio** | Loss Ratio + Expense Ratio | <100% = underwriting profit |

**Combined ratio interpretation:**
- 95% = $0.95 cost per $1 premium = 5% underwriting profit
- 102% = losing money on underwriting, need investment income to profit
- Many carriers run >100% combined, profit on float

### How Insurers Make Money

**Profitable scenario:**
- Combined ratio: 96%
- Investment yield on float: 4%
- Float leverage: 2x equity
- ROE can exceed 15%+ even with thin underwriting margins

**How they lose money:**
- Underpricing risk (inadequate premium for exposure)
- Reserve deficiency (claims cost more than expected)
- Catastrophes (hurricanes, wildfires, pandemics)
- Investment losses
- Expense bloat

### Reserving & Capital

**Reserves:** Liability on balance sheet for future claim payments
- Case reserves (known claims)
- IBNR (Incurred But Not Reported)
- Reserve releases/strengthening impact earnings

**Capital requirements:**
- Risk-Based Capital (RBC) in US
- Solvency II in Europe
- Rating agency capital models (AM Best, S&P)

## 4. Insurance Technology Stack

### Core Systems

| System | Function | Key vendors |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Policy Administration** | Quote, bind, issue, endorse, renew | Guidewire, Duck Creek, Majesco, Socotra |
| **Billing** | Premium collection, payment plans, commission | Often bundled with policy admin |
| **Claims** | FNOL, adjudication, payments, litigation | Guidewire ClaimCenter, Snapsheet |

### Data & Analytics Platforms
- **Rating engines:** Real-time premium calculation
- **Predictive models:** Loss propensity, fraud detection, pricing optimization
- **Data enrichment:** Pre-fill, third-party data append
- **BI/Reporting:** Portfolio analytics, reserving, regulatory reporting

### Distribution Technology
- Agent portals and comparative raters
- Digital quoting APIs
- CRM and lead management
- Document management

### Legacy vs Modern Architecture

**Legacy reality:**
- Many carriers run 20-40 year old systems
- Mainframe-based, COBOL, batch processing
- Highly customized, expensive to maintain
- "System of record" mentality

**Modern approach:**
- Cloud-native, API-first
- Microservices architecture
- Real-time processing
- Configurable vs customized
- Headless core + best-of-breed ecosystem

**The challenge:** Carriers can't "rip and replace" overnight. Multi-year modernization, often line-by-line migration.

## 5. Insurtech Landscape

### Wave 1 (2012-2018): Disrupt the Carriers
- Full-stack carriers trying to replace incumbents
- Heavy VC funding, growth over profit
- Examples: Lemonade, Oscar, Metromile, Root
- Reality check: insurance is hard, capital-intensive, regulated

### Wave 2 (2018-present): Enable the Ecosystem
- B2B enablers helping incumbents modernize
- Less capital-intensive, faster path to revenue
- Infrastructure, data, workflow tools
- Examples: Socotra, Highspot, Federato, Archipelago

## 7. Market Dynamics

### Hard vs Soft Markets

**Soft market:**
- Excess capacity, competition for business
- Rates declining or flat
- Broad coverage terms
- Easy to place risk

**Hard market:**
- Capacity constrained
- Rates increasing significantly
- Coverage restrictions, exclusions
- Difficult to place certain risks

**Cycle drivers:** Cat losses, investment returns, reserve development, new capital entry/exit

**2020-2024 context:** Hard market in many lines, especially commercial property, cyber, D&O

### Capacity & Capital Flows
- Alternative capital (ILS, cat bonds) provides additional capacity
- Bermuda market for reinsurance and specialty
- Lloyd's of London as specialty marketplace
- Private equity interest in insurance distribution (MGAs, brokers)

### Regulatory Landscape

**US: State-based regulation**
- Each state has insurance department
- Rate/form filing requirements vary
- Surplus lines for non-admitted carriers
- NAIC provides model laws, coordination

**International:**
- Solvency II (EU) - capital requirements framework
- Lloyd's regulation (UK)
- Bermuda Monetary Authority

**Key regulatory concerns:**
- Solvency/capital adequacy
- Market conduct
- Rate adequacy/fairness
- Data privacy (especially for AI/ML pricing)
