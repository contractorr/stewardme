**The deal:** Savers deposit/invest → Intermediaries allocate capital → Borrowers/businesses get funding → Returns flow back

## 3. Business Model Deep Dive

### Banking Economics

**Net Interest Income (NII):**
```
Interest Earned on Assets - Interest Paid on Liabilities = NII
```

**Net Interest Margin (NIM):**
```
NII / Average Earning Assets = NIM (typically 2.5-4%)
```

**Revenue mix:**
- Net interest income: 50-70%
- Fee income: 30-50% (interchange, wealth management, advisory, trading)

**Key metrics:**
| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **NIM** | Net interest margin | 2.5-4% |
| **Efficiency ratio** | Non-interest expense / Revenue | <60% good |
| **ROA** | Return on assets | 1%+ |
| **ROE** | Return on equity | 10-15% |
| **NPL ratio** | Non-performing loans / Total loans | <2% |
| **CET1** | Common Equity Tier 1 ratio | >10% |

### Payments Economics

**Interchange economics (card transaction):**
```
$100 purchase
- Interchange: ~1.5-2% → Issuer
- Network fee: ~0.1% → Visa/MC
- Acquirer markup: ~0.2-0.5% → Acquirer/processor
= Merchant pays ~2-2.5%
```

**Revenue models:**
- Transaction fees (% + fixed per txn)
- Subscription/platform fees
- FX spread on cross-border
- Value-added services (fraud, analytics)

### Lending Economics

**Spread business:**
```
Interest Rate Charged - Cost of Funds - Credit Losses - Operating Costs = Profit
```

**Key metrics:**
- Origination volume
- Loan yield
- Cost of funds
- Charge-off rate / NCO (Net Charge-Offs)
- Delinquency rates (30/60/90 DPD)

### Capital Markets Economics

- **Trading:** Bid-ask spread, market-making revenue
- **Investment banking:** Advisory fees (% of deal), underwriting spread
- **Asset management:** AUM × management fee (typically 0.1-2%)
- **Prime brokerage:** Securities lending, margin interest, execution
