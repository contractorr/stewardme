# Government & GovTech Industry Crash Course
*Business Models & Technology Focus*

---

## 1. Government Tech Fundamentals

### Core Concept: Public Sector Service Delivery
GovTech = technology enabling government operations and citizen services. Government is largest employer, biggest buyer, operates essential services, but constrained by procurement rules, budgets, and political cycles.

**The mission:** Efficient public service delivery, citizen engagement, regulatory compliance, public safety

### Government Levels

|-------|-------|----------|
| **Federal** | National agencies | IRS, SSA, DHS, DoD, VA, CMS |
| **State** | State-level services | DMV, Medicaid, unemployment, courts |
| **Local** | City/county | Permits, utilities, police, schools |
| **Tribal** | Native American nations | Self-governed services |

### Major Function Areas

| Function | Activities | Tech intensity |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| **Benefits/social services** | Unemployment, SNAP, Medicaid | High - eligtic systems |
| **Tax/revenue** | Collection, compliance | High - core systems |
| **Public safety** | Law enforcement, courts, corrections | Medium - CAD, records |
| **Transportation** | DMV, transit, infrastructure | Medium |
| **Permitting/licensing** | Business, construction, professional | Growing digital |
| **Education** | K-12, higher ed administration | Variable |
| **Health** | Public health, vital records | Growing (post-COVID) |

## 3. Business Model Deep Dive

### Government Procurement

**Contract types:**

| Type | Description | Risk |
|------|-------------|------|
| **Firm fixed price (FFP)** | Set price for deliverables | Contractor bears overrun risk |
| **Time & materials (T&M)** | Hourly rates, materials | Government bears risk |
| **Cost-plus** | Reimbursed costs + fee | Government bears risk, common DoD |
| **IDIQ** | Indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity | Framework for task orders |

**Contract vehicles:**
- GSA Schedule (federal simplified buying)
- GWACs (Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts)
- BPAs (Blanket Purchase Agreements)
- State master contracts

### Procurement Process

```
RFI → RFP → Proposals → Evaluation → Award → Protest period → Contract
```

**Timelines:**
- Federal: 6-18 months typical
- State/local: 3-12 months
- Small purchases: Can be faster

### Revenue Models (GovTech)

| Model | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **License + maintenance** | Traditional software | Legacy vendors |
| **SaaS subscription** | Annual/monthly fee | Modern platforms |
| **Transaction-based** | Per transaction/user | Payments, permits |
| **Implementation + support** | Services-heavy | Integrators |

### Economics

**Government characteristics:**
- Long sales cycles (6-24 months)
- Sticky customers (5-10+ year relationships)
- Predictable revenue (budget cycles)
- Lower margins than commercial (competitive)
- Compliance overhead

**Typical metrics:**
- Win rate on proposals
- Contract ceiling vs actual spend
- Customer retention
- CAGR on contract vehicles
