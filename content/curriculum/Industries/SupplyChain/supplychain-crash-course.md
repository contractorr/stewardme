# Supply Chain & Logistics Industry Crash Course
*Business Models & Technology Focus*

---

## 1. Supply Chain Fundamentals

### Core Concept: Moving Goods from Source to Consumer
Supply chain = network of organizations, activities, resources involved in creating and delivering products. Logistics = physical movement and storage component.

**The flow:** Raw materials → Manufacturing → Distribution → Retail → Consumer

### Key Components

| Component | What it does | Key activities |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Sourcing/Procurement** | Acquire materials and services | Supplier selection, contracts, purchasing |
| **Manufacturing** | Transform inputs to products | Production planning, quality control |
| **Warehousing** | Store and stage inventory | Receiving, put-away, picking, packing |
| **Transportation** | Move goods between locations | Carrier selection, routing, tracking |
| **Last-mile delivery** | Final leg to consumer | Parcel delivery, local distribution |
| **Returns/Reverse logistics** | Handle returns and recycling | RMA processing, refurbishment |

| **Trucking (LTL)** | Partial loads, consolidated | FedEx Freight, XPO, Old Dominion |
| **Rail** | Long-haul bulk/heavy goods | Union Pacific, BNSF, CSX |
| **Ocean** | International shipping | Maersk, MSC, CMA CGM |
| **Air freight** | High-value, time-sensitive | FedEx, UPS, DHL |
| **Parcel** | Small packages, B2C/B2B | UPS, FedEx, USPS, Amazon |

### Logistics Service Providers

| Type | Role | Examples |
|------|------|----------|
| **3PL** | Outsourced logistics (warehouse, transport) | DHL Supply Chain, XPO, Ryder |
| **4PL** | Manage entire supply chain (asset-light) | Accenture, CH Robinson |

## 3. Business Model Deep Dive

### Asset-Based vs Asset-Light

| Model | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Asset-based** | Own trucks, warehouses, planes | UPS, FedEx, JB Hunt |
| **Asset-light** | Broker/platform, use others' assets | Uber Freight, C.H. Robinson, Flexport |
| **Hybrid** | Some owned, some contracted | XPO, Amazon |

**Tradeoffs:**
- Asset-based: Capital intensive, more control, capacity guarantee
- Asset-light: Lower capex, scalable, margin compression risk

### Transportation Economics

**Trucking:**
```
Revenue = Miles × Rate per Mile
Cost = Driver + Fuel + Equipment + Insurance + Maintenance
```

Key metrics:
- Revenue per mile ($2-4 typical)
- Operating ratio (expenses/revenue, <90% is good)
- Deadhead % (empty miles)
- Driver turnover

**Ocean shipping:**
- Container rates (per TEU or FEU)
- Spot vs contract rates
- Fuel surcharges (BAF)
- Port charges, documentation fees

### Warehousing Economics

**Cost structure:**
- Storage: Per pallet per month
- Handling: Per unit in/out
- Labor: Pick, pack, ship
- Value-added services: Kitting, labeling, returns

**Key metrics:**
- Cost per order
- Orders per labor hour
- Inventory turns
- Fill rate
- Perfect order rate

### Brokerage Economics

```
Gross Margin = Customer Rate - Carrier Rate
Net Margin = Gross Margin - Operating Costs
```

Typical gross margin: 10-20%
Key: Volume, carrier relationships, technology for efficiency
